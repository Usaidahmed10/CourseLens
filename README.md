## Inspiration

UofA students were wasting valuable time searching across multiple platforms for course and professor information. We saw an opportunity to consolidate this fragmented data into a single, accessible resource.

## Problem Statement

Students face significant challenges when trying to gather all the necessary course and professor details due to:
- **Fragmented Information:** Details are scattered across platforms like Reddit, BearTracks, and RateMyProf.
- **Disorganized Discussions:** Reddit discussions on courses are hard to navigate.
- **Lack of Quality Assessments:** BearTracks does not offer detailed quality evaluations.
- **Limited Accessibility Data:** There is very little information on course-specific accessibility accommodations available online.

## Key Issues

- **Inefficiency:** Students miss out on opportunities to engage with high-quality instructors.
- **Inadequate Assessment:** It is difficult for students to gauge overall course difficulty.
- **Accessibility Barriers:** Students requiring accessibility accommodations struggle to find courses that meet their needs.

## Our Solution

**UAlberta CourseLens** addresses these issues by offering a unified platform that:
- Aggregates course information from multiple sources.
- Provides detailed professor reviews and ratings.
- Highlights course-specific accessibility features.
- Offers insights into course difficulty levels based on student feedback.
